  "aboutpara": "My journey as a web developer was full of amazing experiences. I started my career in IT field when I was still an intern, and I have learned a lot from building websites to setting up WPEngines. Through their training, I acquired many skills including PHP, WordPress, HTML & CSS, and proper work etiquette. After my internship, I got a chance to teach on a private school. This improved my interpersonal skills greatly as well as my technical skills. Right now, I am a full stack developer in a growing start-up company making web applications using Laravel, Vue, jQuery, HTML5, CSS. On my free time, I am currently learning React and Next.js because I want to create websites for a hobby. Slowly but surely, it is!",
